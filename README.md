# In brief #
These are my vim files. I use pathogen to manage plugin madness and have most
of them attached as git submodules.

# The Colors Duke! The Colors #
Yeah, so I have a lot of color schemes installed. I changed colors and fonts
periodically because I find that shaking things up helps me avoid eye strain
I doubt anyone but myself is actually going to clone this but if there is a
demand I can move these to a separate repo and make them a removable submodule
but since I cycle through them and this is my config they will stay here until
I need to change that.

# Git and Mercurial #
I am primarily a Mercurial user. Though I've used git for a fair number of
projects. There is or will soon be a mirror of this project on
[bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/nuclearsandwich/vimfiles).
